## About The Project

![Screenshot of Phrase Hunter](https://github.com/Stelkooo/oop-game-show-app/blob/main/images/phraseHunterScreenshot.png)

This is a browser based word guessing game

It is uses JavaScript with a OOP approach to select a random hidden phrase which a player tries to guess by clicking on the onscreen keyboard or their physical keyboard

It uses two classes Game and Phrase.

The Game class is used to manage the game while the Phrase class deals with the phrase randomly selected

I changed a few things about the styling of the game, they include:

- The initial starting overlay background colour
- Font
- Keyboard buttons transition and colour when they are pressed
- The colour and way letters from the phrase get revealed
- Win and lose colour overlay

### Built With

- JavaScript
- OOP Approach
- Callback Functions
